Write-up for PA2J
-----------------

The regex specification for jflex is split into 11 parts: whitespace, line comments
block comments, string, multi-character operators, integers, keywords, typeids,
object ids, single character ids, and unmatched characters.

whitespace, multi-character operators, integers, keywords, type ids, object ids,
single character ids, and unmatched characters are simple regex expressions.
That leaves line comments, block comments, and strings.

"--" signifies the start
of a LINE_COMMENT %state. While in this state all characters should be ignored
except newline which increments curr_lineno.

"(*) starts the BLOCK_COMMENT state. this state also increments curr_lineno on
a new line and ends with "(*". Because cool allows nested comments the number
of "(*" and "(*" need to be tracked. This can be done by incrementing and
decrementing a variable. All other characters are ignored. EOF inside a block
comment raises an error.

""" starts the STRING state. The four escape characters are explicitly checked.
newline, null, and EOF cause an error token. "\" starts the BACKSLASH_ESCAPE
state. In this state null and EOF still cause an error. All other characters
are accepted in both states. Because null and EOF may not be the end of the
token and he specification says to continue parsing a flag is set to true
and used to raise the error after the closing """ is found.

Commenting in the file is sparse because there is not very much code and all
of the code follows basic jflex.

The test cases on the other hand are fully commented. The test cases themselves
try to hit every possible token as concisely as possible, followed by a short
example program (the original test.cl). The tests also hit almost all of the
error states (couldn't figure out how to put an EOF in the middle of a test
file :\ ).
